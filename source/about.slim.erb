		h2 A little about me...
		p While perched up in my Brooklyn loft amongst the countless abandoned factories and never-ending hard gray landscape, I like to imagine a city where the trees grow as tall as skyscrapers and run as deep as the subway tunnels. I have been living in New York City for the past 10 years, where I spent the first half studying Visual Arts at Fordham University Lincoln Center and the second half working as a web designer and developer in Manhattan.
		p No matter where I am or what I am doing, art has been an underlying and defining force throughout my life. While I have worked with many subjects and media, of late I have been creating surrealistic cityscapes using pen and ink, capturing the creepy and whimsical quality of the city streets I walk along everyday.
